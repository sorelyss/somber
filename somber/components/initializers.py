    Initialize the weights by calculating the range of the data.

    The data range is calculated by reshaping the input matrix to a
    2D matrix, and then taking the min and max values over the columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : numpy array
        The input data. The data range is calculated over the last axis.
    num_weights : int
        The number of weights to initialize.

    Returns
    -------
    new_weights : numpy array
        A new version of the weights, initialized to the data range specified
        by X.
